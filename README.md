# 100000 sql dorks for search
In order to analyze the entire Internet and all sites that are not prohibited from indexing in search engines, I generated my list of 100,000 doroks. Each of the docks was written in the following variants: 
.php, 
.aspx, 
.asp, 
.cfm, 
.html, 
.cgi. 

These dorks will help you find a site with sql injections.
